#   SCANNER_XDPI
#   SCANNER_YDPI
#   SCANNER_HEIGHT
#   SCANNER_WIDTH
#   SCANNER_PAGE (starts from 1)
#   SCANNER_IP
#   SCANNER_SCANID (to group a set of scanned pages)
#   SCANNER_HOSTNAME (as selected on the device)
#   SCANNER_FUNC (as selected on the device)
#   SCANNER_FILENAME (where the received data was stored), e.g. scan123.jpg

# The script is also called after all pages of a set have been received,
# in this case SCANNER_FILENAME will not be set.
# For a set of pages, you can expect the variables to stay the same (except for
# SCANNER_PAGE and SCANNER_FILENAME).
